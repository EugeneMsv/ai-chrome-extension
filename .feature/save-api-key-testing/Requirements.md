# Feature Requirements: save-api-key-testing

## Feature Name
save-api-key-testing

## Feature Description
We need to focus only on the background part of the Chrome extension and write as high level as possible integration testing primarily testing the process of API key storage and update. It seems the good way to test would be just run background script as a black box and send the message for saveApiKey and then later checking if it worked by actually calling the chrome storage API and comparing the values. The test should follow Given/When/Then principles as well as trying to be as less boilerplate as possible but not having any hardcoded values, apart from some constants as message name and etc. The test must check corner cases.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Background Script Integration Testing**
   - Test the background service worker in isolation
   - Use black-box testing approach
   - Focus specifically on API key storage and update functionality

2. **Message-Based Testing**
   - Send `saveApiKey` messages to background script
   - Verify storage operations through Chrome storage API
   - Test message handling and response mechanisms

3. **Test Structure Requirements**
   - Follow Given/When/Then (Gherkin-style) test structure
   - Minimize boilerplate code while maintaining clarity
   - Avoid hardcoded values except for essential constants (message names, etc.)

4. **Corner Case Coverage**
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Validate error handling scenarios
   - Test boundary conditions and invalid inputs

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **High-Level Integration Focus**
   - Test at the highest possible integration level
   - Avoid unit testing of internal implementation details
   - Focus on end-to-end behavior verification

2. **Maintainability**
   - Minimize test maintenance burden
   - Use configuration-driven test data
   - Ensure tests are self-contained and independent

3. **Chrome Extension Compatibility**
   - Work within Manifest V3 constraints
   - Utilize Chrome extension testing APIs appropriately
   - Handle service worker lifecycle correctly

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture
- Chrome Extension with Manifest V3
- Background service worker handles API key management
- Message-based communication between content scripts and background
- Chrome storage API for persistent data storage
- `apiKeyManager.js` module manages API key operations

### Testing Scope
- **In Scope**: Background service worker API key storage/update functionality
- **Out of Scope**: Content scripts, UI components, popup handlers
- **Focus Area**: Message handling, storage operations, error conditions

### Success Criteria
- Complete test coverage of API key storage scenarios
- Robust corner case handling validation
- Clean, maintainable test structure
- No hardcoded test data (except constants)
- Given/When/Then test organization
- Black-box testing approach verification
